# smart-compound-project
it provides a smaller scale of a safe smart city where
1. resources usage is optimized using sensors inside each building to monitor Sewage line break probability , gas leaks inside buildings ,
      optimizing consumptions of electricity and water
 
2. access is monitored and controlled on compound gate by writing access cards to visitors in addition to property gates that checks for the access codes of owners and visitors 
      and informs of unauthorised entry trials  
      
3. data is encrypted and safely transferred between compound units ( properties and control room ) by sending alerts from each property to the control room using
    the wifi module installed inside each unit which encypts data before sending and then decrypted when recieved on control room 
    
all this is done using IOT, embedded  microcontrollers (ATMEGA32-arduino uno) , sensors and communication modules ( NODE-MCU)
